NCSOFT is a video game publisher based in Seoul, South Korea. They have several of their own titles and have published several games for studios like [Paragon Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragon_Studios), [ArenaNet](https://www.arena.net/en) and [Carbine Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbine_Studios). 

I started with NCSOFT as a senior javascript developer. There were a lot of ambitions in the company to have bidirectional communication between the games and websites. They had already exposed some generic game data that could be read in rare cases but overall, the sites were mostly static. There was no unified method but I would work with the studio engineers who either provided access to a read-only database or exposed services over a variety of protocols with each project. We built a REST API with support for token-based authentication to consume or work with various external services. This provided a consistent way for sites and web apps to work with game data. 

Not too long after I started at NCSOFT, they decided to relocate the development team to Seattle, WA where they wanted to grow the team significantly. I was offered a lead front-end developer position and a relocation package to move to the Pacific Northwest. My partner and I had already been planning a wedding, so this was both exciting and also just added to the weight of everything. We got married and decided to relocate, so we packed up our belongings and moved to Seattle. Our office was on [4th street between Pike and Pine](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Century+Square/@47.6104582,-122.3371334,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x52f0050f7191c242!8m2!3d47.6104582!4d-122.3371334), so we were in the heart of downtown. 

After about three years of being with the company, I was offered a development manager position. Our development team had grown significantly at this point to a team of 18. This included Java engineers and even a junior developer dedicated to building newsletters. We discussed some changes that needed to be made, that included bringing in a project manager with a background in SCRUM methodologies. Each studio we worked with had their own project manager, this left development with competing priorities. Over 6 months, we ironed out a process with [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and later we introduced [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo). The development team also included a developer in Brighton, UK and another developer in Austin, TX. In addition we met with developers in Seoul bi-weekly to discuss any integration details related to product development. Eventually a liaison from Seoul integrated into the team, which drastically improved our process and throughput for this type of development.

There was no overlap between Brighton, Austin and Seattle, so we engaged in daily standups that included at least one remote developer. Project kick-off meetings where held and included at least one remote developer, we communicated well as a team and over time we became really effective together. 

I enjoyed my time at NCSOFT, where I could push boundaries and significantly grew as an individual. In the end, NCSOFT again moved the development team to Orange County, California. I made the decision not to join them as my partner and I had already discussed relocating to the southeast part of the country, I declined the offer and made the choice to expand on my career working remotely.
