Project Thunder developed an e-commerce and [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) platform as an all-in-one solution. In the early 2000s, many brands and personalities were creating online stores and selling their products. Project Thunder provided services to create and manage online stores and customers for small and midsize businesses. 

It was my job to help clients bring their visions to life. Many clients were established brands or personalities who already had a style guide or a sense of how they would like an online store to look. In most cases, I went into the kickoff meetings well prepared so the client could describe their vision, and we could jump right into ideation. The design phase's deliverables are usually just Photoshop files; in some cases, the client may want to improve the user experience.

Upon completion of the design phase, we would begin development immediately. Due to my lack of experience with the [.NET Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) in the mid-2000s, I struggled with the lack of modularity for frontend components. Eventually, I found the right balance and understood the framework's limitations and features better. I set expectations during the design phase using this information, leaving the development work problem-free.
