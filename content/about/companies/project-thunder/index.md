Project Thunder developed an e-commerce and [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) platform as an all-in-one solution. In the early 2000s, many brands and personalities were creating online stores and selling their products. Project Thunder provided services to create and manage online stores for small and midsize businesses. 

It was my job to help clients bring their visions to life. Many clients were established brands or personalities who already had a style guide or a sense of how they would like an online store to look. In most cases, I went into the kickoff meetings well prepared so the client could describe their vision, and we could jump right into ideation. The design phase's deliverables are usually just Photoshop files; in some cases, the client may want to improve the user experience.

Upon completion of the design phase, we would jump right into development. It was the first and still the only time I've worked with the [.NET Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework). By the time I started working at Project Thunder, they already had a working version of their product and built the front-end using [Web Forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/what-is-web-forms). Unfortunately, this lacked the extendibility that clients were expecting for the site design, so we completely reworked all the front-end views to have more control over the rendered HTML.
