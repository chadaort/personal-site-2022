Snopes is an online fact-checking company that debunks myths and rumors. False information is identified, explored, and corrected by the company in order to combat disinformation.

I manage Snopes' development efforts and do both front-end and back-end development. I support the efforts of the Editorial team, which has had more than 15 members since the property saw traffic as high as 60 million monthly visitors. 

With Stripe and Auth0, I built our membership system. We offer an ad-free viewing experience and a few other member-only features. [This project is described in more detail here](/projects/snopes-membership/).

Another big project that I led was building out infrastructure that would consume event data from external systems and process it to keep all systems up to date. This was used as the middleware between our main properties and all the external vendors that we interface with. [This project is described in more detail here](/projects/central-dispatch/).
