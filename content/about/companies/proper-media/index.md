Proper Media is a technology company that built a proprietary header bidding solution used on several high-traffic publications. Header bidding first started around 2014 and took off in 2015. There was a lot of money to be made by allowing publishers to sell their inventory (ad placements) in an auction before the site started to load. This enabled brands to be more selective about where they place their ads based on the inventory performance and the overall user experience. Proper Media entered the space early with a solid solution and built a long list of clients.

The owners also owned several properties of their own like [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/), [ShareTV](https://sharetv.com/) and later, [Salon](https://www.salon.com/). My time was split between doing interactive development for those sites and ad-tech development. The most challenging work was ad-tech. It’s an industry where you have to stay on the cutting edge because it’s constantly evolving due to the amount of money that pours through the industry. You also have bad actors that try to exploit this process which often creates a horrible user experience where redirected to another site or even the app store. This should not happen and there are companies like [Clean.io](https://www.clean.io) whose core business is to prevent this. 

One of the more significant projects that I took on was to build out a media player that managed a variety of ad types. With each class, you also have multiple formats like [VAST](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/vast/) and [VPAID](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VPAID_2_0_Final_04-10-2012.pdf). This was my first time building out a video player. I had previously worked with FlowPlayer and built my own, so I understood the browser issues but device limitations were a new challenge. I spent more time than I care to admit trying to solve the IOS in-stream player limitation. I built the initial version of something that I’m sure has long since evolved but it was a fun challenge.
