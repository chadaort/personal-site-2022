It was a fair amount of work to migrate Snopes to the block editor since they have a lot of content that was written with the classic editor. The project was too big for me to handle alone, so we hired a project manager and a couple of developers from [Human Made](https://humanmade.com/) for five, two-week sprints.

- Requirements gathering
- Development planning and data modeling
- Block development
- Editorial documentation and training

Since we were rethinking the data model, it was the perfect time to rethink how writers enter data for each of our content types. We met with several members of the editorial team to better understand their workflow and pain points with the classic editor. We had a solid understanding of what they needed after several meetings and going through the story creation process with several writers.

In the [block editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/), you get visual support out of the box so the editorial team can break their content up into columns and apply styles to elements. Having audited all our existing data fields and associated them with business needs, we were able to identify blocks as project requirements. In order to ensure that all stakeholders were satisfied, we focused development sprints on the big-ticket items with immediate editorial value.

The editorial team was happy with the transition and really like working with a more modern editor.
