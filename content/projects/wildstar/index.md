[WildStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildStar_(video_game)) was a fantasy/science fiction MMO game developed by [Carbine Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbine_Studios). I was blown away by the game art and really enjoyed playing the game. There can be a long development cycle for games, and Wildstar was no exception. Their game launched right when the [free-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play) model was introduced. It was just really inconvenient for everyone. 

Kick-off meetings were held between studio and publisher leads. Since studios are also designers, they often come prepared with creative direction. They had already decided to outsource the design to an agency and so over the next 4-6 weeks, we all worked with the agency to produce the project assets. The result was a beautiful design and an IA that translated the game features into a user friendly site experience. 

As soon as the design assets were finalized, we began development. WordPress was chosen because of its familiar development environment and publishing tools. All of our marketing sites were deployed as static sites using various build tools and I had already built a [WordPress plugin to do this for Guild Wars 2](/projects/guildwars2-launch/). To provide content-specific workflows, we broke down the content types by classes, factions, races, etc. Overall, the project was a success, and the community was very happy with the results.
