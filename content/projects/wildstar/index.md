[WildStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildStar_(video_game)) is a fantasy/science fiction MMO game developed by [Carbine Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbine_Studios). It was a pleasure to play the game, and I was blown away by the art. Game development can take a long time, and Wildstar was no exception. [Free-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play) was introduced right when their game launched. It was just really inconvenient for everyone involved in the game. 

A kick-off meeting was held between the studio and publisher leads. As designers, studios often provide creative direction. They decided, however, to outsource the design to an agency, so we all worked with the agency over the next 4-6 weeks to create the project assets. Ultimately, we created a beautiful design and an intuitive user interface that translated the game's features into a user-friendly experience. 

We began development as soon as the design assets were finalized. WordPress was chosen for its familiar development environment and publishing tools. At NCSOFT, we deployed our marketing sites as static sites using various build tools, and I had already built a [WordPress plugin to do this](/projects/guildwars2-launch/). Content types were separated by classes, factions, races, etc., to provide content-specific workflows. Community members were thrilled with the results of the project.
