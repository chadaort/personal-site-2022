Blade and Soul was developed by NCSOFT East and launched in the west about nine after initially launching in the east. It was another beautiful game with a vibrant story. My only complaint with the game is about what free-to-play has done to gameplay.

When we would launch a game in the west that NCSOFT East developed, they would create a product team responsible for the business plan. When it came to the site design, they wanted an a-typical layout. They didn’t have a ton of content at this time or weren’t releasing it to us initially, so there was a lot of room for creativity. The result was a fixed position site navigation that hugged the left side of the window with scrollable body content on the right. 

The [ESRB](https://www.esrb.org/) had given the game the Teen rating, so this was the first site that I had to implement an age gate. We used Javascript to display the verification screen for first-time visitors where user is forced to enter their birthday. If the birthday entered is older than 18 years of age then we granted access otherwise we would display a message letting them know they were not old enough to view the content. We also maintained a list of submissions with the user's IP address to show our due diligence in preventing access to minors.
