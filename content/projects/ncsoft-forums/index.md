NCSOFT provided community forums for most all games using Vbulletin. Each game had its community team that would moderate and engage with players. Community managers are some of the most significant power users and know exactly what tools they want to use. 

We would create a custom theme for each game and either uses our own publisher icon set, or the studios would provide their own icon set. The plugin space for Vbulletin was very hit or miss on whether they would be on par with our strict security requirements, so usually, we couldnâ€™t use them out of the box. We had several plugins that we had created to either player expected features or tooling that moderators needed to maintain quality content.

For the first couple of years that I worked at NCSOFT, a single person had done all the forum development. Then one day, that person left the company and little was known about the process. I got familiar with the plugin architecture and the theming capabilities for several months. I was responsible for making any changes while ironing out and documenting the development pipeline. We had a way to do local development with dummy data, stage changes for QA and use already existing tooling for deploying the changes to production.
