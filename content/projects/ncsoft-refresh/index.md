Corporate site changes, especially redesigns, can have a tricky approval process and this project was no different. We added on about a dozen stakeholders in various capacities through the process. The one thing that everyone was in alignment on was that our corporate site needed to focus on the studios rather than on the publisher. There wasn’t alignment on how it should look and present the games. Each studio had its own unique opinions and to complicate matters, I managed our relationship with the development in Seoul and they were communicating a lot of feedback through me. Our CEO stepped in and drove all the input and effectively made the design decisions.

I managed the project but didn’t do any development work on the project. This was most reskinning the current except for game pages. I’m not sure that everyone was happy with the result but development completed the project on time.
