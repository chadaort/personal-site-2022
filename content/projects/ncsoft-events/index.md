As a publisher, NCSOFT managed a lot of events. We created a dedicated event site on a subdomain of ncsoft.com that allowed the event team to showcase upcoming events with an archive of past events. The other side of this was that our sponsors wanted prime real estate that the company couldnâ€™t do on the leading site. 

This was a project where I took on both the design and development. The procedure followed the existing site with a few new components but I always enjoy taking on a design project from time to time. The development work included the front, customizations for the latest content type in the CMS and writing documentation.
