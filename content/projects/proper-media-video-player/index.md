The video advertising industry has been [growing at a rapid pace](https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/tv-video-advertising/digital-video-advertising/united-states#ad-spending) for years. Proper Media wanted to create a video advertising platform for publishers. The platform allows publishers to upload videos or images to create slideshows so that ads can be injected during playback. Since they already had an extensive ad network, video support made sense for Proper Media.

As part of the project, I was responsible for creating the video player with [VAST](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/vast/) and [VPAID](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VPAID_2_0_Final_04-10-2012.pdf) support. The volume in VAST is often higher, but VPAID offers the advantage of interactivity. So instead of starting from scratch with [HTML5 Video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video), I built all the features on top of [Video.js](https://videojs.com/). This is something I had previously done at NCSOFT and was rather labor-intensive. 

Despite its challenges, the project went well. Advertisers spend a lot of money developing cutting-edge features across different device types to monetize them. So it's challenging to solve for things like in-line videos on IOS, for example.
