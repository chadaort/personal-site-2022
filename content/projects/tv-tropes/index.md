A wiki and forum redesign for TV Tropes was one of the projects I worked on at Proper Media. If you're one of those who notice patterns across the medium or want to understand the bits of storytelling better, TV Tropes is an excellent resource. According to TV Tropes, a trope is:

> A storytelling device or convention, a shortcut for describing situations the storyteller can reasonably assume the audience will recognize. Tropes are how a story is told by anyone who has a story to tell. We collect them for fun involved.

I was already familiar with their wiki but still spent some time reading a bunch of tropes. A couple of my favorite tropes are [Flandarization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) and the [Dead Unicorn](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope). 

I contributed to the project by working on UI design and front-end development.
