The studio behind Guild Wars, ArenaNet, has an incredible passion for their game with some of the most loyal players. There was so much hype about the release of Guild Wars 2 in 2012 that it was probably the best time to work for NCSOFT. 

[Daniel Dociu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-dociu-456a223/) was the art director at ArenaNet who had the creative vision behind Guild Wars 2. His work is stunning and his management style promotes an environment where artists can thrive. The result was impressive art and a beautiful game.

This was a teaser site, so there is no functionality other than newsletter signup. The most challenging part was that we were still supporting IE6 and all the workarounds needed for a pixel-perfect design. I was personally responsible for setting up the development environment and any interactive development for things like the video player and the newsletter signup.
