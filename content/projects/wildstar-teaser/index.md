WildStar's concept art is stunning. Characters were quirky and colors were vibrant and saturated, giving it a dystopian cartoon feel. We struck a good balance between keeping the site user-friendly and maintaining the game's atmosphere.

I managed the development team, so I only wrote the technical specification document and development tickets. With the project's timely completion and highly professional documentation, the studio was well prepared to produce content.
