As part of this project, we migrated a considerably large static site to a CMS and completely redesigned it. Since Lineage 2 was released in 2003, the website was due for a rework. Over time, the site had become a complete mess; 70%+ of all pages had detached from the Dreamweaver templates. In addition, a large content site built in Dreamweaver is a terrible idea, making it difficult to parse the content from all the markup and Dreamweaver code.

The design was beautiful and matched the UI in the game. To account for the different page types, there were about 12 different main template types.

I was responsible for leading the project and writing scripts to migrate the content. Because MovableType is written in Perl, I challenged myself to learn more about the language and wrote all the scripts in Perl. Identifying template differences within the pages of the old system was my biggest project challenge to ensure everything got migrated. It went smoothly, launched on time, and the community team was excited to work on a content management system.
