This was quite a large project where we migrated a considerably large site built with static files over to a CMS and did a complete site redesign. Lineage 2 was released in 2003 and so the site was built seven years before this rework and was due for an overhaul. They had initially created the site using Dreamweaver templates but it had become a complete mess over time; 70%+ of all pages had detached from the template.

The design was beautiful and it matched the feel of the UI from the game. There were about 12 different template styles to account for the various page types. It also provided an overview of each race within the game that used some cool concept art.

I was responsible for leading the project and writing the scripts to migrate the content. I wrote all the scripts in Perl because MovableType is written in Perl and I had been challenging myself to get more familiar with the language. My biggest project challenge was identifying where there were template differences within the pages of the old system to ensure everything was accounted for and got migrated. The project went smoothly, launched on time and the community team was excited to be working within a content management system.
