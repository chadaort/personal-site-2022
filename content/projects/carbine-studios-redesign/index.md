Carbine Studios was the studio behind the fantasy MMO game called Wildstar. It was a dazzling game with excitement going into the release. I think it was a couple of years before they had initially planned to launch that the market started to shift towards [free-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play) quickly. It shook things up a bit within the company and they stuck to the premium subscription model for a while. About a year later, they shifted to free to play.

The site design was a drab brown that they were very adamant about keeping. The design and overall look were effortless and straightforward. We built this out in [Moveable Type](https://movabletype.org/) and used our custom set of CSS utility classes that we shared across projects. I was the lead developer at the time, so I oversaw the project and I also built out the backend for fetching data from our jobs board and displaying it on the front end.
