Carbine Studios created Wildstar, a fantasy MMO game. The game was dazzling, and there was a lot of excitement leading up to its release. However, it wasn't until a couple of years before they had initially planned to launch that the market shifted towards [free-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play). It shook things up a bit within the company, but in the end, they decided to stick with the premium subscription model at launch. Less than a year after launch, they switch to the free-to-play model. 

The design and development of the site were straightforward. Most of the site was informational except for open job listings and resume submissions.
