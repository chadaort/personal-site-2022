As the publisher, NCSOFT managed all the newsletters for any current and upcoming games. Some games had multiple newsletters with varying frequencies and had a reasonably heavy design. Newsletter development at that time was messy. Outlook used Word to render their emails, and Yahoo had its quirks.

At NCSOFT, newsletters had no consistent workflow when I started. Each person had their way of creating them. To standardize the process, I built a publishing and development pipeline and wrote documentation for both the product and development teams. The product and development teams had to collaborate to create each newsletter for a while. After I built a simple drag-and-drop builder in our CMS, we shifted all publishing responsibilities to the product team.
