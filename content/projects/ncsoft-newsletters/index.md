As the publisher, NCSOFT managed all the newsletters for any current and upcoming games. Some games had multiple newsletters with varying frequencies and they all had a heavy design. Newsletter development at that time was messy. Outlook used Word to render their emails and Yahoo had its quirks. Things were starting to improve and before I left NCSOFT, margins had gotten strong support, so that was nice. Every little bit helps, I guess. 

When I started, the company was building newsletters out individually per request. I wasn’t often assigned newsletter development but folks go on vacation and it came up from time to time. It wasn’t something that excited me but it did get me thinking about how the process could be improved. When I took on the lead developer position, I had a pretty good idea about what changes were needed. The most significant change was formalizing the process and making it consistent with all other development.
