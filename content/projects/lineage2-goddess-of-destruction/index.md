Goddess of Destruction was an expansion pack for Lineage 2. Not all expansion packs got a microsite, but this one did because it was a huge update. The development team added 30 new hunting grounds, 60 new raid bosses, and more than 400 new equipment items, making this the most significant content update in the game's seven-year history. 

Lineage 2 was developed by NCSOFT East and was released in Asia initially. After it was publicly released, the game team got their hands on the update. This is when the game team for the release in the west would start making a business plan and localizing the content. This isn't a process in which development is involved, but the output informs the development process. 

It was mostly an informational micro-site, but it included a lot of content pages. There wasn't anything complex about the development work, minus what it takes to develop a liquid layout with an intricate design.
