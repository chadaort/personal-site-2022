Cit of Heros had already been online for six years and Going Rogue was the second expansion pack in the COH universe. The art director for the studio did the site design and did an excellent job designing it in a way that could be converted to code. Most of the design adjustments were related to localization and not factoring that into the design. I was excited about the project because new site builds were always fun when you could do them and the plan was on point.

I was the sole developer on the project and was under a fairly tight schedule considering the upcoming release date. The site is what you would call a microsite and only had around 12 pages. Content on a site like this is relatively static but there will undoubtedly be text changes post-launch, so itâ€™s often better to build it within a content management system. 

Video game sites often have an intricate design and need to be vertically flexible to allow for dynamic content and localization. This was before responsive design and when games designed content frames to look like the user interface in the game. There were usually just small design changes needed to get the repeatable image patterns that we needed. The project was launched on time and met the visual expectations of the art director.
