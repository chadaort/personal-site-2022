Going Rogue was the second expansion pack for City of Heroes, which had already been online for six years. The art director for the studio did the site design so we could easily convert it to code. The majority of the design adjustments were related to localization. It was a fun design to work on.

Due to the upcoming release date, I had a pretty tight schedule as the only developer on the project. As a result, there were only around 12 pages on the site, which you would call a microsite. It's often best to build a site like this within a content management system since the text will undoubtedly change post-launch. 

Video game sites often have intricate designs and need to be vertically flexible to accommodate dynamic content and localization. Back then, content frames were designed to mimic the game's user interface before responsive design. As a result, we usually just needed to make minor design changes to get repeatable image patterns. The project was launched on time and met the art director's visual expectations.
